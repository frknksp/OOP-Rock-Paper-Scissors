## How to Play the Game
At the start of each round, each player will be presented with a list of objects that they can choose from. Each object has a different set of attributes such as strength, speed, and durability. The player can choose one object to use for the round.

After both players have made their selections, the round will start. Each object (rock paper scissors or advanced ones) has a formula for calculating effects against each other. According to this formula, the winner is determined, experience points are added to the winner, and the strength of the losing object is decreased.

The game will continue until one of the players has no objects left, or the maximum number of turns has been reached. The player with the highest total durability of the remaining objects in the NesneListesi wins the game.
